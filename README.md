### Notes
 - Use $ for dollars, but BGN and EUR for leva and euros respectively
 - Use dots - for floating point sign
 - formulas must start with = or they will be treated as normal strings
 - brackets are not supported in formulas - they must respect the order of operations

# ***TODO***
 - add unit tests
 - add a demo
